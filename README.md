# hello-world
My first repository
This file i am creating just to get A clear ideA on how thei github works
i have nothing to say abou this
so this is what i am doing with this file 
yes after doing this you have to do that and this and bla bla whatever
if i make this is a public one isnt it so anyone can edit this file
so this obviously becomes the open source
i am done by the way
